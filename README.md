# TaskTracker

## ðŸ’¡ Motivation

The main intention behind creating this app is a further practice of the [Composable Architecture](https://www.pointfree.co/collections/composable-architecture) on iOS.

Specific features of this to-do list app will be based on following ChatGPT-generated assignment:

### Objective

Create a To-Do List app using the Composable Architecture (TCA). The app should allow users to add, edit, delete, and mark to-do items as completed. Additionally, the app should allow users to filter to-do items by their completion status (All, Completed, Pending).

### Features

1. **Add To-Do Item âœ…**
* The user should be able to add a new to-do item with a title and description.
2. **Edit To-Do Item**
* The user should be able to edit the title and description of an existing to-do item.
3. **Delete To-Do Item âœ…**
* The user should be able to delete a to-do item.
4. **Mark To-Do Item as Completed**
* The user should be able to mark a to-do item as completed or pending.
5. **Filter To-Do Items**
* The user should be able to filter the to-do items by All, Completed, and Pending.
6. **Persist To-Do Items âœ…**
* Use local storage to persist to-do items between app launches (e.g., using UserDefaults or local file storage).
