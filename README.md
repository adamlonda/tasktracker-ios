# TaskTracker

## ðŸ’¡ Motivation

The main intention behind creating this app is a further practice of the [Composable Architecture](https://www.pointfree.co/collections/composable-architecture) on iOS.

Specific features of this to-do list app will be based on following ChatGPT-generated assignment:

### Objective

Create a To-Do List app using the Composable Architecture (TCA). The app should allow users to add, edit, delete, and mark to-do items as completed. Additionally, the app should allow users to filter to-do items by their completion status (All, Completed, Pending).

### Features

1. **Add To-Do Item âœ…**
* The user should be able to add a new to-do item with a title and description.
2. **Edit To-Do Item âœ…**
* The user should be able to edit the title and description of an existing to-do item.
3. **Delete To-Do Item âœ…**
* The user should be able to delete a to-do item.
4. **Mark To-Do Item as Completed âœ…**
* The user should be able to mark a to-do item as completed or pending.
5. **Filter To-Do Items âœ…**
* The user should be able to filter the to-do items by All, Completed, and Pending.
6. **Persist To-Do Items âœ…**
* Use local storage to persist to-do items between app launches (e.g., using UserDefaults or local file storage).
7. **Priority Levels âœ…**
* Let users assign priority levels (e.g., low, medium, high) to tasks, sort tasks by priority.
8. **Due Date âœ…**
* Allow users to set a due date for each task.
9. **Recurring Tasks âœ…**
* Provide an option for users to set tasks as recurring (daily, weekly, monthly, annually).
10. **Move to Trash**
* Instead of permanently deleting a to-do item, users can move it to a Trash Bin.
